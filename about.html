    <section class="problems">
      <h2>Problems I’ve Observed or Experienced</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Limited access to practical mentorship and career pathways</strong> — Many learners have theoretical knowledge but lack real-world projects, mentoring feedback, and network access needed to land first roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Accumulating technical debt in small engineering teams</strong> — Debt reduces velocity, increases bugs and outages, and lowers morale for teams trying to move fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Product accessibility and inclusive design gaps</strong> — Products that ignore accessibility exclude users, increase compliance risk, and reduce market reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding friction for new developers</strong> — Manual environment setup, inconsistent docs, and unclear first tasks delay time-to-productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Burnout and unsustainable work patterns</strong> — Burnout erodes creativity, increases turnover, and damages long-term product quality.</li>
      </ol>
